# Projectile Motion Simulation using opengl

**Projectile motion** is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle (a projectile) that is thrown near the Earth's surface and moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only (in particular, the effects of air resistance are assumed to be negligible).

## How to use:

- Use the **_d_** key to increase initial velocity of the projectile

- Use the **_f_** key to decrease initial velocity of the projectile

- Use the **_a_** key to increase angle of the projectile

- Use the **_s_** key to decrease angle of the projectile

- Use the **_space_** key to start the simulation
